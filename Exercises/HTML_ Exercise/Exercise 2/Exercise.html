      What is a Gamebook?
    </h1>
    <p>
      A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making <strong>choices</strong>. The
<i>narrative</i> branches along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Production of
new gamebooks in the West <sub>decreased</sub> dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away
from <sup>print based media</sup>.
